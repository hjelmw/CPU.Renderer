# 3D-Rasterizer

# Introduction
To better understand how computer graphics work I decided to build a software renderer/rasterizer. For simplicity it will run on the CPU.

# Rasterization (according to Wikipedia)
> The process of taking an image described in a vector graphics format (vertices) and converting it into a raster image, i.e a series of pixels, dots or lines, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented via shapes.

- [ ] Render a 3D model
- [ ] Proper matrix translation/rotation
- [ ] Texture mapping
- [ ] Maybe some simple effects (shadow maps, lighting)
- [ ] Shaders?
- [ ] Come up with a cooler project name
