# CPU 3D Rasterizer/Renderer

To better understand how computer graphics work I decided to build my own _software_ renderer using rasterization as a hobby project.

**3D Rendering** is the process of generating a digital 3-dimensional image, often for use in games or movies. One common way of doing this is through rasterization. **A rasterizer** is a program that takes, as an input, an image described as triangle vertices and converts them into a _raster image_, i.e the corresponding pixels that the triangle would cover on a computer display. 

While developing I mostly followed Trenki's excellent blog post on [developing a software renderer](https://trenki2.github.io/blog/2017/06/06/developing-a-software-renderer-part1/). If you also want to build your own I highly recommend reading it!
